CakePHP Sample App on OpenShift
===============================

This is a quickstart CakePHP application for OpenShift v3 that you can use as a starting point to develop your own application and deploy it on an [OpenShift](https://github.com/openshift/origin) cluster.

If you'd like to install it, follow [these directions](https://github.com/sclorg/cakephp-ex/blob/master/README.md#installation).  

The steps in this document assume that you have access to an OpenShift deployment that you can deploy applications on.
